# 🩺 Disease Classification Using Symptoms

This project builds a multi-class classification model to predict diseases based on patient symptoms. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by identifying patterns in symptom data linked to various diseases.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [YBI Foundation Dataset](https://github.com/ybifoundation/Dataset/blob/main/MultipleDiseasePrediction.csv)
- **Features**: ~100 symptoms (binary)
- **Target**: Disease prognosis (multi-class)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Key Steps
- Loaded and cleaned symptom-based disease dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Built and trained a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluated model with accuracy and classification metrics (precision, recall, F1)
- Visualized feature patterns and symptom correlation

## 📈 Model Performance
- Classifier: Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
